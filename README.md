Did you know that GitHub has a tool for managing and tracking software dependencies, updates, and security issues? It’s called Dependabot, and it’s become very popular among developers working in front-end and web-app development. In this course, Carlos Rivas shows you how to use Dependabot with the help of a small demonstration project.

Learn more about the functionality of Dependabot. Find out how to check for updates, keep pull requests up to date, and check that your tests pass before you merge the pull requests. Carlos walks you through a variety of dependencies and shows you how to manage each of them with Dependabot. Be it an update, a security patch, or a minor revision, this course gives you the skills you need to stay on top of your projects, so you get the most out of your GitHub experience.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
